 <h1>Personal Information</h1>
 
 <h3>
 I am an Australian born and bred 38 year old male, who has started to learn(extremely sporadically atm),<br /> 
 and was an got an A for french in grade 8, 26 years ago (so I forget by next time).<br /> 
 I have studied in Personal training and am also in the beginning of accounting bachelor. Other than that<br /> 
 I have no real formal qualifications but have extensive sales experience, which seems to translate well<br /> 
 into most other areas, with some lateral understanding.<br />
 <br />
 An intersting fact about me is that I love proving the ney sayers wrong. By that I mean if "they" say<br /> 
 it can't be done, then like most people I think either it just hasn't been done yet or, were not trying<br /> 
 hard enough.<br />
 <br />
 "We are born to achieve so why beleive we won't"?

	<h3>	

<br />
<br />
My interests in IT are to gain a basis of understanding of technology that I had never needed in the<br />
past so never sought to obtain, my interest started seriously around 9-12 months ago when I started to<br /> 
buid an online business, and became so aware of expenses and difficulties involved in even beginning<br /> 
the process without any real basic technology knowledge. I really have no technology experience other<br /> 
than setting up home entertainment systems, when I left high school I avoided technolgy so everything<br /> 
is new to me<br />
<br />
<br />
RMIT stood out to me beacause I have heard good things about it's lecturers, their student supports<br /> 
systems, and I did some research on its overall ranking which is impressive. Even though I have an<br /> 
analytical mind, my decisions can be alittle quirky, so once I had done the research and had narrowed<br /> 
the choices down to two, I decided I like Melbourne the city and the RMIT name sold me.<br />
<br />
<br />
The learning expectaions I have set myself are simple and specific, as I have said I need a more<br /> 
advanced basic IT understanding, and using my studies I am setting myself to become a programmer and<br /> 
software engineer, which is going to allow me to combine all my work experience into an online presence<br /> 
that I can have greater control over the progresion and success of. Computer systems and hardware makes<br /> 
me genuinely curious so I have a natural growing interst in AI, and would one day love to work in that<br /> 
field.

		<h3>
This job incorporates two things outside of a new IT career that particularly appeal to me, Bondi<br /> 
Beach and the Financial sector.<br />Being able to with and around experienced Software Engineers<br /> 
building new and advancing existing technologies that I have gained some previous experience using<br /> 
from a different role in the industry, will only help my personal growth.<br />
<br />
I think the area involved with this particular would mean some financial experience would be a huge<br /> 
bonus, the add specifically asks for C++17 knowledge so that would have to be a basic programming<br />
type and area of expertise. It would be a high paced environment so building and maintaing high<br />
functioning teams would be a asset to have as well.<br />
<br />
As far as the experience I have at the moment with programming goes, I have some basic SQL experience,<br />
some Java coding is a skill I am currently working on at the moment. I have in the recent past done<br /> 
some basic Swift online training which was my first introduction to programming 6 months ago<br />,
and am now starting to feel alot more comfortable with HTML and am working to improve my CSS. My<br />
big advantage when I don't have experience is my sales history does tend to have alot of the requirements<br />
for big business teamwork success, and with my experience I am confident in building strong teams.<br />
<br />
My efforts to improve my qualifications are at this point in time firmly focused on this degree and<br /> 
building my experience and with that my confidence as well. In saying that I am on the laptop around<br /> 
12hrs per day at the moment, so I am sgtarting to look for outside tutorials and short courses of <br />
programming types to continually improve my skill set, and ideally make back the ground I gave to<br />
the rest of the people in the IT industry with such a delayed foray in.

	My Own Analysis Of The Results:<br />
Too be completely honest the test results were more of interest to me by showing the psychology that<br />
is used to design these tests, and how that applied gives varying results to very similar question<br />
types. My behaviour in a team should not be dramatically influenced by these specific findings over a<br />
a 20 year work history, more often than not in teams, and more often than not very successful. I will<br />
however not ignore one of the answers specifically rates my conscientiousness as poor, so I will make<br />
a mental note of that to avoid any lapses.

<h2>
<span>Complete Restructure of the education system.</span><br /></h2>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;padding-left:275px">
The project will be aimed at being a complete long-term overhaul of the education system that will<br /> 
integrate the use of technology within the education systems giving students of any age open access<br />
to any learning materials and testing that the implemented technology understands their level in any<br /> 
particular area to be at. It will be aimed at using a testing system that still rates the students, but<br /> 
instead of rating them against their own age brackets it will be aiming to group all people not just<br /> 
students in areas of comparable knowledge, understanding and personality types.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The true motivation of this idea stems from the simple fact that at some point in the future the world<br /> 
we live in will be managed more efficiently and effectively, meaning that there will be a point in the<br /> 
future that every person on the planet is a student at some point in their lives. Effective education<br /> 
does not have to be restricted to only children and younger students, as university level education<br /> 
possibilities have advanced over the last two decades significantly, with it the availability to gain<br /> 
access has improved increasing peoples desires to improve their knowledge through higher learning.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Full internet (self-accessible) profile for everyone on the planet.  As profiling is becoming necessary<br /> 
and is no doubt happening now, it makes more sense to work with the governments to make people<br /> 
far more confident about profiling, knowing it is for their benefit. The profile is essentially the way<br /> 
that every individual will have their own AI interactive teaching aid and assistant.<br />
<br /> 
With a completely interactive profile the AI can constantly (second by second) assess the individuals'<br /> 
complete interactions and reactions. This will also be relevant outside of the education system which<br /> 
this project is ultimately aiming to become a lifelong interactive learning enabler. With the ability<br /> 
to assess individuals as they progress through all activities it allows for constant re-adjustments of<br /> 
the learning materials provided, this can vary from a 8 year old who struggles to write stories, but<br /> 
can excel naturally at computer programming, to a 48 year old nurse who displays such great<br /> 
abilities with trouble patients and situations on the wards that her profiling may have started out<br /> 
when she was 18 as a perfect candidate for nursing but now may indicate she is best suited to be a<br /> 
foreign relations diplomat (for example only), and in the current world people just do not have the<br /> 
ability to make such adjustments in their life. Individuals should always be helped move them <br />
through to the most ideal situation in life for themselves.<br/>
<br />
With what the web provides not only the internet but also with connecting all humans, it will allow for<br /> 
technology to be not only analyzing each individual current and future but also to match them up with<br /> 
the world they are In, by that I mean once governments around the world are truly connected and <br />
working together, then it will mean that the technology will automatically know that one individually is<br /> 
progressing away from one particular field( and the technology will be able to plan it to the second ),<br /> 
meaning it knows well ahead of time where this particular individual will be placed.<br />
<br /> 
Constant upgrading of everyone provided materials means that everyone will always be being provided<br /> 
with information and material that is uniquely relevant to their exact and specific point in life,<br /> 
with regards a lot to do with the AI interaction that will be doing personality assessments 100% of<br /> 
the time. With technology today and more so in the future to literally have 100% of the planet's<br /> 
population interconnected through the web of technology as much as the internet then it means as we<br /> 
become so reliant on technology in our lives the we can also have far greater benefit as 1 population<br /> 
on this planet. An example of this idea will be as one the nurse moves more towards politics or such<br /> 
areas then there will be more people and personalities that are lining themselves up to be a perfect<br /> 
fit for the position needing to be filled, essentially having a world which is 100% positively<br /> 
monitored in all interactions.<br />
<br />
The basis for my product already exists, we have computers whose basic function is to interpret data<br /> 
and logic, and the concept of fully interactive personal assistants is already a commercial free for all,<br /> 
with Cortana, Siri, Google's Alexis being the current market leaders.  With the idea I have it is less<br /> 
about the idea of having a PA that you can talk to  (that will lead to social issue), I am more aiming<br /> 
at the idea that we have an internet that is a literal web of connectivity, so I will stay focused on<br /> 
it being implemented with government policy to protect humans from becoming truly unnecessary by <br />
our own creation.<br />
<br />
I think the main moral issue I see with this style of project is that in the future our physical make<br /> 
up as humans will no doubt have some sort of technological presence, so that is a rather large hurdle<br /> 
to contemplate before being able to convince the worlds population that for their own future protection,<br /> 
that governments will take for control over their entire presence and interactions. I think the main<br /> 
skill needed is a sales type skill to be able to show the world this is necessary to protect us from<br /> 
the likes of Google.<br />
<br />
The outcome I have in mind with this plan being implemented successfully is that there will literally<br /> 
never be a human on the planet who needs to feel worried about if they have a purpose in the future,<br /> 
if they are even capable of achieving better things. With the successful implementation of this system<br /> 
I believe we will finally have true human connectivity, we can take away not just avoid the need for<br /> 
people to make incorrect decisions because they never had the opportunity or ability or even the<br /> 
desire (just need) to learn how to make them.<br />
